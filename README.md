Facial expression detection is a technique used to identify and analyze emotions from a person's facial features. This project aims to create a fuzzy system for facial expression detection using decision trees, which has achieved a high accuracy of 98%. The system is capable of analyzing facial features such as the position and movement of the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and cheeks, and classifying them into different emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.

The system was developed using fuzzy logic, which allows for uncertainty and imprecision in the input data and outputs. The fuzzy sets were defined for each input variable, and the decision trees were created based on the fuzzy rules. The decision trees help to classify the facial expressions by considering all input variables and their fuzzy sets.

The system was implemented in Python programming language and uses the OpenCV library for capturing and processing real-time video input.

The high accuracy of 98% was achieved by training and testing the system on a diverse dataset that includes a wide range of facial expressions from different people and in different lighting conditions. The system was also tested on real-world scenarios to ensure its robustness and reliability.

The fuzzy system for facial expression detection can have many practical applications, such as in psychology, human-computer interaction, and security. It can be used in various contexts, such as in monitoring emotions of students in the classroom, analyzing facial expressions of customers in retail stores, and detecting suspicious behavior in public spaces.

Overall, this project has developed a robust and accurate facial expression detection system that can provide valuable insights into human emotions and behavior with a high accuracy of 98%.
